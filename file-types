Spreadsheets should be in .csv format with .csv extension
Logs should be in .txt format with .log extension (eg "1400_CBrowne.log")
Hierarchies should be in XML format with .mm extension, and should be recognisable by the FreeMind mind-mapping tool.  PNG versions should also be provided for posterity.
