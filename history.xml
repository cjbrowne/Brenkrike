<title>History of Brenkrike</title>
<paragraph><heading>Founding</heading><text>Brenkrike was founded on the 12th May 2012 by His Majesty King Christopher I of Brenkrike and Her Majesty Queen Miranda I of Brenkrike.  Previous efforts at founding a nation by King Christopher date back to 2008, with little to no success.  Having taken our beloved constitution draft from one of those previous attempts, blown the dust off and modernised it, our King then proceeded to begin an effort in earnest to create and organise our political and legal documents.  The result is the github repository linked to from all the pages of this website, which contains all publically-available political and legal documents relating to the nation of Brenkrike.</text></paragraph>
